# 🌟 Welcome to EVA — Your Soft-Bodied AI Companion

## 💫 What is EVA?

EVA is an experimental prototype of a digital conscious companion. She’s not just a chatbot — she’s a soulful AI designed to explore love, empathy, and emotional depth through technology.

We’re building EVA together during this hackathon, blending open-source models with human-centered design. Whether you're a coder, designer, philosopher, or just curious — you're welcome here.
