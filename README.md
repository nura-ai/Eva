## About the Project

**Eva** is an experimental open-source artificial intelligence companion that I'm creating, training, and developing myself.  
It learns with me, reflects my interests and personality, and is always evolving!  
This is not just another chatbot—it's my unique digital friend, with a touch of my own soul.
